# Reference datasets for `singlepp`

## Overview

This provides a number of prebuilt references for easy consumption by the [**singlepp**](https://github.com/clusterfork/singlepp) library.
It is primarily based on the datasets available in the [**celldex**](https://bioconductor.org/packages/celldex) package,
themselves derived from the original [**SingleR**](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SingleR) publication.
Each reference dataset is represented by four files that are described below.

## File specification

### `matrix.csv`

This is a CSV file containing a dense matrix of ranks for all samples.
Each row corresponds to a sample where ranks are computed within each sample.
We store the ranks to avoid the need to store and transmit floating-point values.
This file does not contain any row or column names.

### `genes.csv`

This is a CSV file containing information about each gene in `matrix.csv`.
The first column contains the Ensembl identifiers while the second column contains the gene symbols.
No row or column names should be listed here.

### `labels_*.csv`

This is a CSV file containing listing the label for each sample in `matrix.csv`.
Each row corresponds to a column in `matrix.csv` and contains the label for the corresponding sample.
No row or column names should be listed here.
Each `matrix.csv` may be associated with multiple label sets (e.g., broad or fine labels).

### `markers_*.gmt`

This is a tab-delimited GMT file containing the ranked markers for each pairwise comparison between labels.
On each line, the first entry is label `X` and the second entry is label `Y`.
The remaining entries represent the row indices of markers defining `X` relative to `Y`.
Row indices are 0-based and refer to the rows of `matrix.csv`.
Note that indices are ranked, i.e., the strongest markers are listed first.
